It's not uncommon to hear someone with the question:

> Why did you reinvent the wheel? 

If it were as simple as reinventing the wheel, however, I would be
a lot more relieved. In reality, it's a bit more complicated as to
_why_. The first high level decision in this tree is:

1. Do you want to make something with this wheel? 
2. Do you want to experience the making a wheel?

That is, what is your _primary_ goal with this undertaking? This is
entirely dependent on your own timeline and ambitions--even 
personality. Some are more interesting in understanding the foundations
while others are more focused on creating something with the building
blocks already made for you. 

> Do you want to connect pipes, or would you rather fold metal?

This all comes down to understanding oneself. For many, it's 
hacking. Getting into a system for thrills while gaining a better
understanding of the involved systems. Exploration for knowledge
instead of profit.

That is the idea that I grew up on when it came to computers, during
my childhood. These days, though, the hacks are at a much higher level
of abstraction--not saying there's anything inherently good or bad
about it. Even then, the contemporary hacks are coming full circle
with the transition to thin clients. One may even ask, "why are
they reinventing the wheel?" with a heavy dose of sarcasm.
