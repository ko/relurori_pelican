Title: Google Glass as Rangefinder

An idea crossed my mind while driving. Twice. Oops.
That would mean I forgot to write it down the first time around.

Thinking about Google Glass, I drew a few parallels to street 
photography and how G.Glass has the potential to change things up.

Rangefinders have generally been preferred because "they let you see
the rest of thes scene" or "outside the frame". That is the _primary_
reason I see floating around when people talk about the rangefinder
preference; advantage, even. The fact that you can't see what the
final image is until you're in the dark room has its own magical
qualities. You don't _know_ what was actually captured. You just have
a general idea. A very good idea, usually.

Others have touted their smaller size (seriously, compare any Summicron
to a Nikkor G lens). This helps them stay inconspicuous; an SLR is 
generally seen as daunting. Scary. Peple freeze up, they act 
unnaturally. A rangefinder helps to capture life _as it happens_. That
is what street photography captures--with rangefinders as the common
tool to pull that off. 

Now, Glass falls in both of these camps. 

"Ok, Glass. Take a picture." 

You don't have a viewfinder. There is no rangefinder. In front of your
eyes, there is only the scene. Glass is just capturing it without 
notice (ideally, without notice). 

The size of Glass and its form factor of being on the head (even though
its design stands out) will make you stand out for a while. But people
get used to it. At least, the Bay Area appears to have. I certainly have.

The downfall is really the quality of the sensor. There are going to be
some terrible low light photos, but that's a factor of physics. That 
isn't changing too much any time soon. But you can play this off with
the Holga mindset: **bad on purpose**. Think, toy camera. 

I think Glass will produce some interesting/notable shots. The best part
is that now plebeians (non-photographers) will have the opportunity to 
get a taste of street photography. 

Let that marinate for a while.
