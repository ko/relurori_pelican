Title: Hiking Boots

I need a place to write down my findings about hiking boots. As such, this
is effectively a letter to myself.

More expensive boots will provide:

1. Stiffer sole
2. Leather that is already broken in
3. More durable material (relatively)

What this culminates into is overall comfort. A stiffer sole, for instance, 
will limit the flexing when stepping on uneven terrain or corners of rocky
terrain. More even pressure on the foot as you step down. Broken in 
leather will also give you a "what you try on is what you get" experience.
A WYSIWYG feature!

Now, sizing. If your foot size is N, you'll want to (generally) wear
a size (N+0.5) US shoe. Hopefully your toes don't smash into the shoe wall
when walking downhill. 

For socks, at least midweight half-calf socks. Midweight for the support
of additional cushioning and half-calf length because you don't want the
shoe to be rubbing across your skin for miles on end. 

If there's more to contribute, I'll update with new posts.
