So, dual booting the Chromebook with ChromeOS and Lubuntu/XFCE, and I
noticed that the touchpad was not as _refined_ as it could be while under
the X window system. I just happened upon this post[0] while looking up
crouton for a chroot (eventually threw that idea out once I had it
finally working). 

I didn't actually bother to see/diff what the changes are, but it's 
apparently better off. Tap-to-click even works. With my habit of backups,
I feel that I should mirror the X11 config at some point, because two is
one and one is none.
