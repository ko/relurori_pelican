There are a few points that I'd like to address for the new year
regarding my online persona(s). 

1. Word-of-mouth score
2. Write consistently
3. Consolidation

Points one (1) and three (3) are pretty closely tied. Word-of-mouth
score refers to how easy it would be for me to say, and for someone
to accurately transcribe, my domains. **relurori** for instance, is
pretty bad. I'd like to change that and possibly consolidate both
**relurori** with **kenkophoto**. Granted, I do like those names,
but an easier-to-say portal would possibly help accessibility. 
Something generic.

The other is to write more consistently. I have ideas. I have github
issues marked to remind me to write. I just don't write. This may
have to supplement the coding side of my time. In the past, I've 
found that writing and even drawing out thoughts helps with
organization.

Have to try hard not to make this equivalent to a myspace/facebook
page. Definitely no auto-playing music.
