Title: Learn or Refine?

Let's say we spend 30 minutes every weeknight learning something new.
Now, keep in mind that this is _actual_ learning. Not including 
prep and setup time; just, focused on learning. Doesn't matter if this
is repetition or learning something new. It's time spent focused on
a single task.

Back to our example: 

> Five days a week. One hour every weeknight. One year.

This adds up to 260 hours per year. 

Now, let's look at a normal occupation. 

> Five days a week. Eight hours per day. One year.

This adds up to 2080 hours per year.

Now, spending an hour outside of "work hours" increases our "practice"
time by a bit over 10%. One, then, wonders whether it's more beneficial
to spend that hour on a an activity that is _not_ work related. While
gaining 10% additional experience is nice, 260 hours in a totally 
different domain can also be helpful in influencing a different train
of thought or even introduction to problems that would have gone 
unnoticed. 

Worth it?
